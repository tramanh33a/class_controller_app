## Login

On startup, a loading screen appears. You can log in as a professor, or login as a student provided you enter your name.

## Group

If you logged in a professor, you can see all groups, add them, edit them, and delete and add students. If you have not yet loaded a student, the other tabs will be empty. You can load in a student by selecting one and then clicking the view student button. If you are a student, you only see your group members, and cannot edit the groups or load in students. However, you can see their backlog, sprint, and tasks in each if you expand on them. 

## Backlog

If you are a student, you can add items to the backlog by clicking the add task button. When an an item is selected you can add subtasks by clicking the add subtask button. You can explore the tree by collapsing and expanding items. All items are editable by double clicking. When ready, you can select a task and add it to the sprint by clicking the add to sprint button. If you are a professor, this screen is only viewable.

## Sprint

Once you items are in the sprint view, you can check off tasks and subtasks. You can also rename the sprint using the button. When you're ready to finish the sprint, click the button in the lower right. This will open a pop-up window so a sprint reflection can be submitted. If you are a professor, this screen is only viewable.

## Archive

In the archive, you can see all your past sprints sorted by date of completion. Expanding a sprint allows you to see the reflection, along with each task and subtask, and if they were completed.

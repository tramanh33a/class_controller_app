Improvement 1: UI Improvements

- UI Space not effectively used
- Lack of View Student Indicator
- Switching Tabs Gives no UI Indicator
- Sprint Reflection Box is too Small

To-do steps:

1. Draw out the expected design so that we can focus on designing UI before implementing.
2. Deciding on dimensions of the features.
3. Combined tabs might be further discussed to improve on less clicking.
4. Switching tabs selections â†’ redesign on indicating selected tabs differently.

Our focus for the first improvement will be the UI of the application. Currently, the UI is too small on the screen which makes it hard to see. The pixel dimensions are hard-coded into the resources files which should be changed to percentage values. The current application also does a poor job of communicating what screen the user is actively using. We plan to add indicators to show when certain information is active. For example, when the view student button is clicked, rather than having tabs to click through in the main window, we want to create a pop up window that has all of the information readily available. Other information that requires clicking or changing the window would then be highlighted or changed to a brighter/darker color to reflect which window is currently presented.

Improvement 2: Feature Additions

- No Way to Comment on and View Other Student's Sprints and Reflections
- Cannot delete a group
- Can't log out
- QOL functionality
- Bug with adding new students

To-do steps:

1. Fix bugs
2. Re-design the class structure to include new commenting functionality
3. Add simple new functions to existing classes such as deleting a group
4. Plan out concrete new QOL functions to implement

There are some essential ease-of-use features that are missing from the application. There is no logout feature or settings tab. The UI elements of the window that we are addressing in improvement 1 also speak to a lack of accessibility. For improvement 2 we plan to add the functionality of commenting on other students' sprints and reflections. This feature will be an extension of the student pop-up from improvement 1, where there will be an add comment button. This could be considered a quality of life improvement, since now team members can add small comments through the interface, rather than waiting until the next meeting for just a small suggestion. When clicking add a comment, a text box will appear where the user can type their comment and hit enter to confirm. Only the student and professor can see comments on their tabs, but anyone can add comments to other members within their group. When a student logs in, there will be a comments tab they can click, which will display all of the comments other students or the professor have made.
